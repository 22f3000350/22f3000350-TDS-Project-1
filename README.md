- I scraped the data using the GitHub API, specifically targeting the users' endpoint to gather information on developers located in Melbourne with over 100 followers. The process involved creating a personal access token to authenticate requests and using pagination to handle the large volume of data, given that there are approximately 39,000 users. I implemented filtering based on the location parameter to specifically target users in Melbourne, ensuring that only relevant data was collected. Each userâ€™s profile provided critical details such as their usernames, full names, email addresses (when available), company affiliations, hireable status, and a list of their public repositories. This method allowed for efficient data extraction while adhering to the API's usage limits.
- The most interesting and surprising fact I discovered after analyzing the data was that Python and JavaScript emerged as the most popular programming languages among developers. Additionally, I encountered a language called "D," which was unexpected. Upon further investigation, I learned that D is often utilized in game development, highlighting the diverse range of languages used within the developer community.
- An actionable recommendation for developers is to ensure that they complete their GitHub profiles with comprehensive details, including their company name, bio, email, and the programming languages they use. This practice can significantly enhance their visibility and help them gain more followers. Additionally, developers should prioritize learning popular languages like Python and JavaScript, as these skills are highly sought after in the industry and can open up more opportunities for collaboration and networking.
