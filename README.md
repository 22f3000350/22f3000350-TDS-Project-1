- I scraped the data using the GitHub API, specifically targeting the users' endpoint to gather information on developers located in Melbourne with over 100 followers. The process involved creating a personal access token to authenticate requests and using pagination to handle the large volume of data, given that there are approximately 39,000 users. I implemented filtering based on the location parameter to specifically target users in Melbourne, ensuring that only relevant data was collected. Each userâ€™s profile provided critical details such as their usernames, full names, email addresses (when available), company affiliations, hireable status, and a list of their public repositories. This method allowed for efficient data extraction while adhering to the API's usage limits.
